## Presentation
This add-on provides a way to quickly insert blocks of text you type frequently in documents you write.
To better organize the text blocks, they can be grouped into categories.
It is possible to set a category as default to quickly access its blocks.


## Usage
To start using this add-on you will need to set the categories and fill the blocks of text you want to use.
For that, first press Windows+f12. You can modify this command in the "Input gestures" dialog box in the "Text editing" section.
A dialog box will be displayed where the existing categories will be shown. In the first use you should press Enter, or TAB to the "Add" button and activate it, to create the categories you want to use.
With a selected category, pressing Enter or activating the "Show Blocks" button, a dialog box with the text blocks in this category will be displayed.
In addition to the "Add" and "Show Blocks" options, you also have the "Rename", "Set as default" and "Delete" options.
When the blocks dialog box for a category opens,  all existing blocks are shown.
To open the block list of the default category, or in the lack of it, of the first category in the categories list, press Control + Windows + F12.
If there is no blocks, you should press Enter, or TAB to access the "Add" button and activate it, to create the blocks you want.
In the first dialog, type the name of the block and press Enter or activate the "Ok" button.
It will present a dialog to type the block of text.
Enter the lines you want, and when done, press Tab and activate the "Ok" button.

To paste the block of text in an edit field, just select the block and press Enter.

In the add-on dialog box you also can rename, change the contents, move to other category, delete the block of text or go back to categories dialog.
